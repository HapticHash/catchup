# CatchUp
The project CatchUp aims at helping like-minded people locate each other, join various events or organize events based on their interests. CatchUp would track down people with similar interests and display their location on a map. Furthermore, the map will highlight various events related to the user’s sought after interests. User can have a look at event details, join a new event, drop out of the previously joined event which is yet to occur.
 
Users can also use the application to plan an event. User can create an event and maintain the record of the details of people that would attend the event. Also, the event creator would be able to plan the most suitable site for an event by locating a spot on the map where the number of people with desirable interest is maximum.
 
Although there are numerous applications that facilitate locating events related to a particular theme, there isn’t any popular application that helps common people find other similar people and organize events at the same time. Some applications are either not user-friendly enough, some don’t let filter events as per user choices, some don’t facilitate event creation. We have planned to build CatchUp to offer a platform that would take care of it all and cater to common people’s interests. Be it a simple cookie eating event, a charity meetup, or a complex hacking competition, CatchUp will help find all.
 
Our target customers will be common people and event planning organizations as well. Sports clubs, Music bands, yoga practitioners, art and craft enthusiasts, foodies, community welfare groups, anyone could use CatchUp to find similar people, join an event, or create an event.
 
Methodology: CatchUp would be a web-based responsive application. As it would be at a small level for now and has to be delivered in a short time span, we have planned to build CatchUp by following agile methodology.
